Projects worked on as part of Computer Science Classes:

Intro to AI: CSCI331
  Project is two AI systems written in Python from scratch for classifying whether a given text file is Deutch or English. One learns by generating and testing attribute weights, one using a staticly defined attribute tree;  includes testing file.

Parallel and Distributed Systems: CSCI251
  Project 1 is a Java based TCP Client/Server connection across two Docker containers that sends a csv file (meant for food reviews), counts their words on the server side, and returns the word count to the client.
  Project 2 is a threaded Java program meant to simulate gossipping protocols. There are two Peer classes that implement a common Peer interface. One simulates a resource management protocol, connecting selecting peers in other containers and tranferring data between them. The second simulates a computation protocol - each peer generates a number and they communicate selectively to determine which peer has the highest number.
  
MIPS Assembly*: CSCI250
  This project written from scratch simulates a 'forest fire' cellular automata. The project handles reading in specifications for a board, simulating, updating, and printing it.
  *Note that is based on a specific RIT simulator for MIPS.
